# CS-Fundamentals

While programming desktop apps, designing websites and tinkering with electronics are fun pasttimes of mine,
I'm aware that in order to progress as a CS student, especially a self-taught one, fundamentals are required to truly understand 
how your software toolkit works. 

CS-Fundamentals is an ongoing project for me to implement the fundamental data structures and algorithms in Computer Science such as linked lists, 
stacks, queues, insertion sort, bubble sort, recursion etc.
