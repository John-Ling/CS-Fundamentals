# Algorithms are fun

A collection of data structures and algorithms I've found and implemented through C (maybe Python if I'm feeling lazy).
These algorithms are NOT efficient. They prioritise being understandable and easy to visualise over various tricks to improve performance. The idea is that you (you being me) can understand fundamentally how they work easily. Then you (still me) can search online for more efficient implementations should they actually need to use them for a non-trivial program.
