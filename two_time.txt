We could leave the lights on
Sun tan
We could get lunch
Aw, man
I think that I like you
(You do?)
Yeah
But something bugs me 'bout the way you lick your envelopes so

I'm out on the block again
So hopped up that I can't pretend
Two time
Stay friends
Problem that you can't defend
Hands up, feel okay
Whose heart could I break today?
Two time
Stay friends
Problem that you can't defend
Oh...

Slip me in your pocket
Chew the way out
Oh man, was that your last piece of gum?
(Come on!) But we both wanted some
I know, and you can get in the hole too
E-R, what can you say
I never read the package anyway

I'm out on the block again
So hopped up that I can't pretend
Two time
Stay friends
Problem that you can't defend
Hands up, feel okay
Whose heart could I break today?
Two time
Stay friends
Problem that you can't defend
