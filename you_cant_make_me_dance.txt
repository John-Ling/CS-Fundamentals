Mister DJ
I know you're trying to take control of me
You're so cheeky (sneaky man)
Trying to do away with my autonomy
But you can't make me dance tonight
So you might as well stop the music
'Cause you ain't got a chance alright
Of getting this body moving
It's refusing
Give up, you're clearly losing
Never gonna break it down
Check my tail feather
Do you see it shaking now?
(I didn't think so)
Both leggies
Fully rigid in my trow
So still I
Make a statue envious
Okay, I can see how
(When I was moving)
It looked a lot like I was boogying
But I was just bending down
(In time with the music)
Which gave a rhythmical illusion
If you saw me grooving
You're confused
How much fruit punch have you had?
See my booty shaking?
You're mistaken
You must've eaten something bad
How many fingers am I holding up?
No, it's three
Thumbs don't count
We should really get you checked out
'Cause you can't make me dance tonight
You're fighting a losing battle
I'm in a rock hard stance
I'm locked tight
You want my feet nomadic
It's pathetic
Give up, I'm clearly static
You try to lure me with your energy
Though I can fight you off so effortlessly, yeah
I swear my neck's not pumping to the beat
My friend, Hugh, said something true
I'm nodding because I agree
'Cause you can't make me dance tonight
No, I'm not doing the Macarena
These moves are happenchance, alright
I'm just feeling for my wallet
It's not my fault it looks so freakin' flawless (flawless)
Never gonna break it down
Check my tail feather
Do you see it shaking now?
(I didn't think so)
Both leggies
Fully rigid in my trow
So still I
Make a statue envious (four, three)
